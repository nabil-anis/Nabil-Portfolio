# Nabil | Engineer. Builder. Designer.

A premium, Apple-inspired portfolio built for Nabil—a Computer Scientist with an instinct for design and a discipline for building high-leverage systems.

## 🏗️ The Philosophy
> "A builder, not a spectator. A mind wired for systems, flows, and elegant shortcuts."

This project reflects a commitment to technical rigour and aesthetic restraint. It isn't just a showcase of work; it's a demonstration of the builder's philosophy: technology should be as refined as a physical object.

- **Dynamic Previews**: Live screenshots of hosted projects rendered inside macOS-style browser frames.
- **System Parameters**: An interactive hero console allowing users to toggle logic, aesthetics, and sarcasm levels.
